                        A New Direction.

                        <p>I have always enjoyed learning how things work. The type of jobs I have really support this now that I think of it. I’ve worked in bars and restaurants for fourteen years, it's kind of a part of my personality at this point. When I visit a new restaurant I try to figure out how it is run. I pay attention to the hosts, waitstaff, management, and especially the layout. They all show the priorities the owners have for the businesses. I guess you’d call it a hobby but I try to figure out how to make these places operate more smoothly.
                            </p>
                        <p>My other job in Logistics requires me to actually put this hobby of mine to use. I keep track of things like customer orders, product inventory, and routing for the drivers that deliver and install the product in customers homes. Every day new problems come up and while some of them have easy fixes other require more creative approaches. The opportunity to find new and efficient ways to fix these make the job fulfilling and enjoyable for me.
                            </p>
                        <p>This is why coding has always held my interest. It exists to allow people to be creative and solve problems. When a friend of mine showed me an ad for a workshop that @LubbockCodingAcademy had posted, looking for people interested in learning to code and specifically building a website I was very interested. Now, a few web pages into the class I am hooked on coding. Whenever I have free time I am elbows deep in tutorials or articles to help me with the class. This is actually one of my first assignments, and this blog is a chronicle of my journey to become a coder. So, I guess i’m a blogger now! This is just the beginning for me. Thank you @AustinCodingAcademy and @LubbockCodingAcademy for opening this door, lets see where this goes!
